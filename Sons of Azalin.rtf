# <br>Preface\par
The preface is written for the double page, but right now i would like it to remain private.\par
<!-- \par
In 2002, a young boy had picked up two large cardboard boxes with PC games from a metal bin in a local discount store - it was a 2 for 1 special offer, and even though he very much wanted to get more, he could only afford these two - carefully selected from a wide selection of choice, based on nothing more than cover art, little description on the back, and a couple of screen-shots presenting the gameplay. One of them, painted blue, with a knight commanding an assault on a mighty castle, and an army ammased form various fantasy creatures contained a strategy game - one of the legendary titles that shaped the genre for years to come. It was important for this boy, to a degree. The other box, pitch-black, with but a single depiction of a bleeding eye and a title that shaped this boys entire future.\par
\par
"\{\{SpecialFont Neverwinter Nights\}\}", because that was the title on a box edition of the game, was a PC game built upon a certain legacy: the \{\{SpecialFont Dungeon's & Dragons\}\} RPG system, namely in the \{\{SpecialFont Forgotten Realms\}\} setting; and a long-line of previous iterations of adaptation of the various edition to PC games. This particular game started my passion for fantasy role-playing, and storytelling at large. Yes - I have red Tolkien's "Lord of the Rings", and i have been reading on "Harry Potter" series, but it is within the Realms that a burning passion had been born.\par
\par
Unfortuantelly, it had been almost two decades, since I've been able to roll the dice with friends at a common table at first, it was a simple, starter adventure; ran by a colleague; 5th edition differed a lot from my expectations that rose on my knowledge about \{\{SpecialFont Advanced Dungeons and Dragons\}\} and the third iteration of the rules. Nonetheless, it was really fun, it later transformed into an adventure designed by said colleague, and I still remember how thrilled I was to one day design my own adventure - which was soon to come.\par
\par
With the rise of online D&D groups, I gathered a party, and began running my first adventure - inspired by the \{\{SpecialFont Forgotten Realms\}\}, but separate enough as to not intimidate the players, not myself. There were, of course, many plot-holes in this world of mine, and juggling the responsibilities of a \{\{SpecialFont Dungeon Master\}\}\par

<!-- \par
was no easy task for me, mind you, but soon after I was completely hooked, and with 4 different group of adventurers the campaigns sprawled into different directions. The conclusion had not been reached by all - there are a lot of things I could have handled better, but overall, considering these were my first steps on that wonderful path of a storyteller - I can't think about that times in any other terms than a success.\par
\par
From that experience another campaign arose, which would be my greatest failure up to date. A campaign designed in every detail, each event pre-planned many sessions in advance, every plot-point merticulously laid down by me before the characters were even created- more experienced \{\{SpecialFont Dungeon Masters\}\} already know, what happened next - the agency of my players, and the main characters of the story was nullified. They were on rails - they had some limited illusion that their choices mattered, when they really didn't. They felt a deep frustration, that the adventure had potential - there were some pretty sights, after all - but it was behind a glass, too distant to touch.\par

After that, I had some luck to take part in a \{\{SpecialFont Curse of Strahd\}\} campaign, during which I've experienced the freedom, and true player agency firsthand, and truly understood what my campaigns have been missing; what I have denied to my players: \{\{SpecialFont Sons of Azalin\}\} module seeks to rectify that mistake.\par
\par
Based on the established lore (with some changes and adjustments), this adventure seeks to explore mature themes, and give the players as much agency as possible, even though Horror - the genre of this campaign - often depends on disempowerment - embrace this whenever you can. The adventure throws player characters against impossible odds, but it is expected that the party will prevail, through creativity, perserverance and will.\par
\par
That being said: \{\{SpecialFont Sons of Azalin\}\} is designed with a good, or at least neutral aligned party. The people of Darkon live in misery that needs to be dispeled by the heroes, and while it does make sense for the party to give up all that King Azalin wants from them, the consequences of doing so are dire, and all rewards turn to dust when the domain of Darkon begins to crumble, if Azalin escapes his imprisonment by the Dark Powers. This might be a start of a whole new, differet adventure; but such events lie beyond the scope of this module.\par
\par
As I see it, during writing of this adventure, Azalin Rex is an irredeemable evil. He may not see himself in that way, and he may hide behind a guile of reason or empathy. The Wizard King is not above deception, appealing to reason, greed or whatever noble intent he can exploit to achieve his goals, but ultimatelly he is a tyrant, who killed his own son, and now seeks to restore him not out of true regret, but rather to erease the affront to his power that is the fact that Irik is beyond his reach. In truth, the darklord of Darkon suffers more from his curse of being unable to learn new magic, than from the fact that his son is dead.\par
\par
You might want to make the adventure in Darkon even grander. A few guidelines i may suggest is embracing the motiffs presented in this book: "Love versus Law", "Freedom versus Loyalty", abusive, controlling parents\par

# <br>Introduction\par
\par
Amidst the ominous ambiance of the foreboding landscape, the towering silhouette of Darkon's dread ruler, Azalin Rex, looms against the ancient stone walls of his cursed fortress. Castle Avernus, perched on a jagged peak, casts a haunting shadow over the desolate land. The night is silent, save for the distant howls of unseen creatures, and a chilling wind that sweeps through the desolation.\par
\par
Under the oppressive sky, Azalin Rex stands with an air of calculated malevolence, surveying the domain below. A sheer cliff plunges into the abyss, and the villages beneath bear the scars of centuries under his dark rule. The necromantic master of Avernus wears a regal cloak that billows around him, absorbing the eerie glow of the pale moonlight.\par
\par
Suddenly, a surge of spectral energy courses through the air, crackling with dark magic. Azalin Rex turns his piercing gaze towards the horizon, where a party of intrepid adventurers has ventured into his cursed realm. He smiles, a wicked glint in his eyes betraying both power and a tinge of madness that mirrors the twisted history of Darkon.\par
\par
As the adventurers navigate the treacherous landscape, guided by a mysterious force, Azalin Rex orchestrates his malevolent plan with the precision of a puppeteer pulling strings. The haunting echoes of his laughter resonate through Castle Avernus, mingling with the distant rumble of thunder that seems to herald the unfolding of a sinister design.\par
\par
A flash of unnatural light illuminates Azalin's gaunt features, revealing the angular lines of his face and the skeletal hands that bear the weight of unspoken tragedies. The wind howls louder, carrying whispers of dark secrets as the master of Avernus disappears from view. The night air is left pregnant with a sense of impending doom, and the adventurers find themselves unknowingly invited into the twisted machinations of Azalin Rex, the dreadlord of Darkon. The shadows deepen, and the stage is set for a night of perilous adventure where the line between life and undeath blurs in the presence of Castle Avernus' enigmatic master.\par

## Running the Adventure\par
\{\{SpecialFont [Adventure Title]\}\} is a story of gothic horror, presented here as \{\{SpecialFont Dungeons & Dragons\}\} roleplaying game adventure for a party of four to six adventurers of levels [10-16]. A balance of character classes is helpful, since the adventuers will face a variety of challenges. Each character class will certainly have its moment to shine, although it should be noted that since the historical 'linear fighter and quadratic wizard', the spellcasting classes will naturally have more opportunities during this adventure, as it is prepared for higher tiers of play.\par
\par
As the adventure starts at higher level, you may consider running it as a continuation of adventures for a party that has completed a previous module - \{\{SpecialFont Curse of Strahd\}\} is a perfect adventure to run beforehand, especially if you are able to seed the clues about Azalin's relationship with Strahd von Zarovitch. Knowledge about that adventure is not required, but may provide a wider context to this adventure.\par
This book is meant for you, the \{\{SpecialFont Dungeon Master\}\}, alone. I recommend you read the entire adventure before attempting to run it. It assumes that you have the fifth edition \{\{SpecialFont Player's Handbook\}\}, \{\{SpecialFont Dungeon Master's Guide\}\} and \{\{SpecialFont Monster Manual\}\}. \par
\par
The \{\{SpecialFont Monster Manual\}\} contains stat blocks for some of the monsters and nonplayer characters (NPCs) found in this adventure. Descriptions and stat blocks for new monsters and NPCs are provided in appendix D. Spells and nonmaical items mentioned in this adventure are described in the \{\{SpecialFont Player's Handbook\}\}. Magic items are described in the \{\{SpecialFont Dungeon Master's Guide\}\}, unless the adventure text directs you to an item's description in appendix C.\par
\par
For the ease of use, various creatures and items entioned in the book, and are appearing in given chapter are color-coded.\par
:\par
\{\{Enemy    \f1\u9658?\f0  An enemy, such as a skeleton, vampire or lich  \}\}  \par
\{\{NPC      \f1\u9658?\f0  A neutral NPC, such as Burgomaster             \}\}  \par

### Story Overview\par
The story begins with a group of adventurers foreign to Darkon - be it from another Domain of Dread or beyond the mists of Ravenloft entirely. As they arrive to the domain of Azalin, they find themselves trapped in this hostile land. When they stumble across a young amnesiac wizard Firan Zal'Honan, that's being chased by Azalin's secret police - the Kargat - it becomes clear that they must take action.\par
\par
Darkon is a land under the tyranny of the undead - vampires, ghouls and liches - where the commoners might either obey or disappear. There is little hope for the good-hearted, but the realm blooms with opportunities to take advantage of the weak and poor. Many decide to take it.\par
\par
Divided into seven administrative regions, Darkon is a realm of bureaucracy: The evil and the wicked rule with pen and paper more so than a clenched fist - all the while maintaning the image of Azalin as some kind of pious savior, or a kindly grandfather, who is kept in the dark by his lieutenants - all the while Azalin himself couldn't care less about the opressed.\par
\par
As of the party's arrival, the Wizard King of Darkon is trying out another of his gambits to escape the grasp of the Dark Powers, and flee his domain - and he may yet succeed: with time, it becomes more and more apparent that the young amnesiac that seems completely out of place in this realm might be instrumental in Azalin's grand design.\par
\par
The darklord of Darkon is many things, but not a wild animal. Learning about the new, powerful outsiders, he will investigate if they may further his goals - and since the web of his influence extends into every corner of his domain, this is almost sure to be true. He might extend an invitation, a letter of acknowledgement... or an offer that simply cannot be rejected.\par
\par
The adventurers' best hope of escaping these nightmarish lands is to be granted Azalin's permission to leave; but he is not going to allow passage freely - in fact, the consequences of paying his price would be most dire... Another possibility is to just destroy Azalin - once, and for all - but how? He is powerful, and supposedly, liches cannot be destroyed. Either way, the adventurers will need to scour Darkon in search of lore, alliances to forge, and Azalin's key servants to slay.\par
\par
The adventure ends when either Azalin or The Party escapes Darkon. Your goal is to judge and jury, ensure that Azalin constantly makes some kind of progress towards his ultimate goals, using all of his resources.\par

# Chapter I <br> Azalin Rex\par
## Backstory Recap\par
\par
In life, Azalin, born under the name of Firan Zal'honan was a powerful wizard-king (a title in his language "Azal'lann", was misheard by the people of Darkon, and stuck), and an emotionally abusive parent who lawfully beheaded his only beloved son, Irik, when the Wizard Kings agents caught Irik assisting underground guerilla opposing his overbearing lordship. In old age, Azalin came to regret executing his son and believed he could fix Irik if only he had a second chance. \par
\par
The sorrowful father became a lich to learn magic that would revive Irik, but was pulled into Ravenloft before he could realize that goal. Now a ghost, Irik is unwilling to be revived, and so Azalins past attempts to convince him or otherwise force his reincarnation have failed. Azalin is also unwilling to let anyone else try to revive his precious son.\par
\par
Arriving at Ravenloft, Azalin first entered Barovia, where he briefly cooperated with Strahd von Zarovich, whom he taught magic, but in this time realized that he became cursed by the Dark Powers - he was unable to learn new spells. Even so, in magic the lich was more powerful than the vampire, but this, amongst other differences caused the two to loathe eachother - and so Azalin escaped Barovia only to be imprisoned in Darkon, which became his own domain in 579 BC (Barovian Calendar). Ever since, Azalin ploted his escape - but each attemt to date had failed.\par
\par
## The Gambit\par
Azalin's newest plan is to split himself so half can escape Ravenloft with Irik's soul. He plans to leave behind enough of himself so that Darkon still has a Darklord and the Dark Powers are appeased. The free half of Azalin can rebuild a kingdom in Oerth, become a lich once more, collect new artifacts, and search the multiverse for a spell to revive Irik.\par
\par
Azalin constructed an arcane apparatus in Castle Avernus, put Irik's soul in a gold dragon skull amulet, and initiated the terrifying magical reaction to sunder himself. The half with the amulet would be free to wander Ravenloft and \par
\par
\{\{pageNumber,auto\}\}\par
\{\{footnote CHAPTER 1 | AZALIN REX \}\}\par
\\page\par
eventually find an escape. The Darklord-half, who refuses to be the half that must remain in the misty prison of Darkon, is locked in the King's Tear - which is a jewel suspended mid-air above Darkon, appearing as a new star, that permanently shines it's golden light from the skies - so he can't stop the other half's escape attempt\par
\par
The plan went awry at the splitting stage. The amulet-owning, human-half Firan Zal\rquote honan lost most of his memory. He can't remember splitting himself, why the pendant is very important (just that it is), exactly why he needs to escape Darkon (just that he hates it), or that he even has a cherished son. The locked-away half of Azalin can help him remember, but that half does not want Firan and Irik to leave. The locked-away half will tempt whoever he can to lure Firan back to him or else to free himself from imprisonment. If Azalin manages to lure and trap Firan in Castle Avernus, he may be able to swap his conciousness with the other half, which will enable him to actually escape the Mists.\par
\par
As the gambit had seemingly failed, this is not Azalin's final say, for he had already concocted another. Following the scattered lore of Barovia, Azalin discovered that lich Osybus supposedly ascended to become a Dark Power. He wants it for himself, but Azalin doesn't know how - and for that reason he needs to find Amber Sacrophagus of Osybus - which he thinks lays in some yet unsearched location in Darkon.\par
\par
This plan, however, is doomed to fail - and spectacularly so. Osybus didn't become a dark power - merely a vestige (as these are separate entities), a remnant of great power. Osybus' sarcophagus may yet grant Azalin - or anyone else - the gift of the Amber Ritual; unbeknownst to Azalin though, as a result, he too would become imprisoned in an ember sarcophagus - his power greatly improved, but himself even more tightly imprisoned, unable to leave the amber prison - an event that would greatly entertain the Dark Powers.\par
\par
However, while the Dark Powers might put this plan to foil, it would spell doom for the people of Darkon - as the demiplane would no longer reckognize a Darklord, and the mists would begin to devour it whole.\par
\par
## Roleplaying Darcalus Rex\par
Kings-Tear half Azalin is panicking because Irik's soul is vulnerable to all of Ravenloft's horrors while Firan bumbles around ignorantly. The sundering spell has also created a few small \ldblquote Azalin fragments\rdblquote  which have embedded themselves in various Darkonian personalities: the potential inheritors to the crown.\par
\par
\par
\par
\par
## Roleplaying Firan Zal'honan\par
\par
Firan slowly remembers details of his life, that eventually lead him to want to confront Darcalus-half. In King of the Dead Firan remembered having a son and that an evil tyrant killed him; eventually he remembered this was Darcalus or Azalin Rex's doing and sought revenge.\par
\par
\{\{Divider \}\}\par
\par
I like the idea of Irik being around the Demiplane. If I was DMing, meeting him would happen when the character are of a upper medium level and ready to discover the true nature of the Demiplane (or something close to it). Irik wants them to help him to unite both halves of his father either because only by being himself Azalin can break the curse or because his absence puts the people of Darkon in greater danger due to the "domain dissolving" thing. Maybe both at once.\par

Darkon is a land of mingled memories and altered histories. Spells that detect, read, create or alter memories or thoughts have a risk of attracting Azalin's attention. He instantly becomes aware when, and on whom such spell is being cast, and what alteration or is attempted. Each time such spell is used, roll a d4. on 1, Azalin decides the full outcome of the spell. He can present false memories or thoughts as true; he can impart different memories on the target of the spell, than the caster wished to; and so on. The caster does not become aware of this interference when it happens.\par
\par
Spells that raise, create, or control the undead are stronger in Darkon. Each such spell counts as if they were cast with a spell slot of one level higher for the purpose of calculating the statistics and number of such undead creatures, as well as the spell dura\par

Lady Mayor **Baroness Karimana Reldkasen** is a competent, ambitious woman who loyally serves the lord of Darkon and wants the best for her city of Martira Bay. In 747 BC she betrayed the corruption of her first husband to Azalin Rex and was appointed to succeed him as mayor. She subsequently appointed Alanik Ray to the office of Chief Constable of the City Constabulary. Her judgement in respect to the Harbor Watch has been less inspired. She consults with the most powerful guilds and holds all merchants responsible for paying their taxes. She lives on the fourth floor of in the Government Palace with her new husband and her three young children, although she hardly has time for either. Curiously, she is supposed to have received her initial magical training from Azalin himself.\par

## Vampires of Ravenloft\par
Vampires of Ravenloft can become much more powerful than their counterparts from other settings. Whenever a "Vampire" is mentioned, use the Ravenloft Vampire stat-block provided below. All vampiric stat-blocks use the Vampiric Mist Form and Vampiric Bat Form, for clarity of use. The vampires of Ravenloft share the common weaknesses of their counterparts form other realms: They cannot enter the residence of another without invitation from one of the occupants (but can get such an invitation from a charmed person), and they are paralyzed if a wooden stake pierces their heart while they are regenerating in their lair. Moreover, the vampires of Ravenloft have two additional weaknesses, not mentioned in their stat-blocks.\par
\par
The first one is their Doom. All of the Ravenloftian vampires has a prophecised doom - a set of circumstances which surely leads to their ultimate demise. If these circumstances are met, the vampire is destroyed (it doesn't revert to a mist form). The second weakness is salting their grave. If a vampire has the soil of it's grave mixed with salt, it loses it's Misty Escape trait (but not the ability to turn into mist). It becomes instantly aware of this, when it enters it's lair. This process can be reversed by performing a special ritual involving draining a humanoid off its blood, or removing the salt completely (even if some of the grave soil is removed with it).\par

***Shapechanger***. If the vampire isn't in sunlight or running water, it can use its action to polymorph into a Tiny bat or a Medium cloud of mist, or back into its true form. While in bat form, the vampire can't speak, its walking speed is 5 feet, and it has a flying speed of 30 feet. Its statistics, other than its size and speed, are unchanged. Anything it is wearing transforms with it, but nothing it is carrying does. It reverts to its true form if it dies. While in mist form, the vampire can't take any actions, speak, or manipulate objects. It is weightless, has a flying speed of 20 feet, can hover, and can enter a hostile creature's space and stop there. In addition, if air can pass through a space, the mist can do so without squeezing, and it can't pass through water. It has advantage on Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution saving throws, and it is immune to all nonmagical damage, except the damage it takes from sunlight.\par
:\par
***Legendary Resistance (3/Day).*** If the vampire fails a saving throw, it can choose to succeed instead.\par
:\par
***Misty Escape.*** When it drops to 0 hit points outside its resting place, the vampire transforms into a cloud of mist (as in the Shapechanger trait) instead of falling unconscious, provided that it isn't in sunlight or running water. If it can't transform, it is destroyed. While it has 0 hit points in mist form, it can't revert to its vampire form, and it must reach its resting place within 2 hours or be destroyed. Once in its resting place, it reverts to its vampire form. It is then paralyzed until it regains at least 1 hit point. After spending 1 hour in its resting place with 0 hit points, it regains 1 hit point.\par
:\par
***Regeneration.*** The vampire regains 20 hit points at the start of its turn if it has at least 1 hit point and isn't in sunlight or running water. If the vampire takes radiant damage or damage from holy water, this trait doesn't function at the start of the vampire's next turn.\par
:\par
***Spider Climb.*** The vampire can climb difficult surfaces, including upside down on ceilings, without needing to make an ability check.\par
:\par
***Vampire Weaknesses.*** The vampire has the following flaws:\par
  - Forbiddance. The vampire can't enter a residence without an invitation from one of the occupants.\par
  - Harmed by Running Water. The vampire takes 20 acid damage if it ends its turn in running water.\par
  - Stake to the Heart. If a piercing weapon made of wood is driven into the vampire's heart while the vampire is incapacitated in its resting place, the vampire is paralyzed until the stake is removed.\par
  - Sunlight Hypersensitivity. The vampire takes 20 radiant damage when it starts its turn in sunlight. While in sunlight, it has disadvantage on attack rolls and ability checks.\par
### Actions\par
***Multiattack (Vampire Form Only).*** Alcio makes three attacks, only one of which can be a bite attack.\par
:\par
***Bite.(Bat or Vampire Form Only)*** _Melee Weapon Attack_: +9 to hit, reach 5 ft., one willing creature, or a creature that is grappled by the vampire, incapacitated, or restrained. Hit: 7 (1d6 + 4) piercing damage plus 10 (3d6) necrotic damage. The target's hit point maximum is reduced by an amount equal to the necrotic damage taken, and the vampire regains hit points equal to that amount. The reduction lasts until the target finishes a long rest. The target dies if this effect reduces its hit point maximum to 0. A humanoid slain in this way and then buried in the ground rises the following night as a vampire spawn under the vampire's control.\par
:\par
***Unarmed Strike (Vampire Form Only).*** Melee Weapon Attack: +11 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. Hit: 10 (1d8 + 6) bludgeoning damage. Instead of dealing damage, the vampire can grapple the target (escape DC 18).\par
:\par
***+2 Katana (Vampire Form Only).*** Melee Weapon Attack: +13 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. Hit: 12 (1d8 + 8) slashing damage.\par
:\par
***Charm.*** The vampire targets one humanoid it can see within 30 feet of it. If the target can see the vampire, the target must succeed on a DC 17 Wisdom saving throw against this magic or be charmed by the vampire. The charmed target regards the vampire as a trusted friend to be heeded and protected. Although the target isn't under the vampire's control, it takes the vampire's requests or actions in the most favorable way it can, and it is a willing target for the vampire's bit attack. Each time the vampire or the vampire's companions do anything harmful to the target, it can repeat the saving throw, ending the effect on itself on a success. Otherwise, the effect lasts 24 hours or until the vampire is destroyed, is on a different plane of existence than the target, or takes a bonus action to end the effect.\par
:\par
***Children ofthe Night (1/Day)***. The vampire magically calls 2d4 swarms of bats or rats, provided that the sun isn't up. While outdoors, the vampire can call 3d6 wolves instead. The called creatures arrive in 1d4 rounds, acting as allies of the vampire and obeying its spoken commands. The beasts remain for 1 hour, until the vampire dies, or until the vampire dismisses them as a bonus action.\par
\par
### Legendary Actions\par
The vampire can take 3 legendary actions, choosing from the options below. Only one legendary action option can be used at a time and only at the end of another creature's turn. The vampire regains spent legendary actions at the start of its turn.\par

The Queen of Hearts wears elegant, turquose dresses with red accents, most often than not revealing her sharp clavicles, and a ruby-decorated crown. Always in her hand, a playing card - with her own likeness.\par
